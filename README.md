# Bank Event Simulation

This program implements an event-driven simulation of a bank, where customers arrive at the bank and go through transactions. The simulation tracks the number of customers, their cumulative waiting time, and computes the average waiting time after processing all events.

## Features

- **Event-driven Simulation**: The program simulates events in the bank, such as customer arrivals and departures.
- **Event List**: Maintains a list of events, including the next arrival event and the next departure event, sorted by their respective times.
- **Event Processing**: Processes arrival and departure events, updating the simulation state and statistics.
- **Statistics**: Tracks the total number of customers processed and their cumulative waiting time.
- **Trace**: Displays a trace of executed events during the simulation.
- **Summary**: Provides a summary of the computed statistics, including the total number of arrivals and the average time spent waiting in line.
